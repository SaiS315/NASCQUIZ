You will be greeted with this landing page, where you are asked to select a difficulty level to play the quiz: easy, medium, hard, and a mixed difficulty where you can anwswer questions combined of all three difficulties.
You can even select a category of questions that you want to answer along with the difficulty (Balancing of questions is still a WIP).

Once you reach the end of the quiz, you see this fleshed out screen with all of the results that you could ask for, including a section
for the questions you got right in each category, and an explanation for each correct question, whether you got it right or wrong. From there, you can choose to 
take the quiz again or go back to the home page.
